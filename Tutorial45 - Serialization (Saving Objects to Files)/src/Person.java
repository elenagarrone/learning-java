import java.io.Serializable;

// To make a serializable object or class:

public class Person implements Serializable {

	private static final long serialVersionUID = 4801633306273802062L;
	private int id;
	private String name;
	
	public Person(int id, String name) {
		this.id = id;
		this.name = name;
	}

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Person [id=" + id + ", name=" + name + "]";
	}
	
}

// Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization.
